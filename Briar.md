### Backstory

Briar Willowbend hails from the **High Forest**, a vast and ancient woodland in the North of Faerûn, home to a variety of fey creatures and ancient trees. Born among a secluded community of wood elves, Briar learned the ways of the druids and absorbed the wisdom of the forest from a young age.

As a child, she explored the High Forest, befriending woodland creatures and discovering its secrets. However, a dark force began to encroach upon her home, threatening the balance of nature. Recognizing her strong connection to the natural world, the elders encouraged Briar to seek knowledge and allies beyond the forest.

Now, she travels to gather information, protect the natural world, and confront the forces that threaten her beloved High Forest. With a heart attuned to nature and a fierce determination, Briar strives to restore harmony wherever she goes.
