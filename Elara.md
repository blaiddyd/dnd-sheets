### Backstory

Elara Nightshade, a **Tiefling** born in **Elturel**, has always walked a fine line between light and darkness. Growing up in a city renowned for its unwavering commitment to justice, she often found herself at odds with societal norms. Her infernal heritage made her a target for prejudice, leading her to seek refuge in the shadows of the city.

In her quest for acceptance and power, Elara forged a pact with a Fiend, a cunning and malevolent entity from the lower planes. This dark bargain granted her arcane powers but also bound her to the will of her patron. The Fiend's whispers guided her, providing her with spells and abilities that enhanced her natural talents as a rogue.

Now, as a **Warlock**, Elara harnesses her newfound powers to navigate the complexities of her life. With her patron's influence, she has learned to manipulate the very essence of darkness, using it to achieve her goals. Her ability to summon a fiendish familiar allows her to gather information and perform tasks that further her agenda.

Despite her dealings with dark forces, Elara has not lost sight of her desire to protect her home. She understands the danger that the encroaching darkness poses to Elturel and aims to use her abilities to gather intelligence and combat threats. However, her ambition and reliance on her Fiendish patron sometimes lead her into morally gray territory, forcing her to question her choices.

Elara walks a tightrope between her allegiance to her patron and her commitment to her own ideals. In a city where shadows loom large even under the brightest light, she hopes to find a way to wield her powers for good while staying true to her chaotic nature. Ultimately, Elara seeks to carve out a place for herself in a world that has never fully accepted her, using every tool at her disposalâ€”be it shadow, cunning, or arcane might.
