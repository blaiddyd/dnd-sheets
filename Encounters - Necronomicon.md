*“I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?”*  
(Answer: An Echo)

Failure to answer correctly results in the door summoning **4 Animated Armors** (use stats for Animated Armor) to attack the party, along with **2 Golems** (use stats for Stone Golems) that emerge to defend the entrance.

**Description:** The party enters a dimly lit corridor where shadows flicker and dance along the walls. The air grows cold, and a sense of unease fills the space.

**Challenge:** As they traverse the hall, they trigger a magical trap that summons **8 Shadows** (use stats for Shadows) to attack, attempting to drain strength and instill fear. Additionally, the corridor is lined with **spike traps** that require a **DC 14 Perception check** to notice and a **DC 14 Dexterity saving throw** to avoid taking **1d10 piercing damage**.
