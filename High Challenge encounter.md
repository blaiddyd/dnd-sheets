Absolutely! Here’s the updated encounter set in a Banite temple:

### Encounter: The Cursed Temple of Bane

**Level:** 3-4 (High Challenge)  
**Location:** The Ruined Temple of Bane in the Shadowtop Forest

---

**Description:**
The party comes across the ruins of a once-majestic temple dedicated to Bane, the Lord of Tyranny. Though crumbling and overgrown, the temple still radiates dark energy. Local legends speak of the temple being haunted by the remnants of Banite zealots and a powerful lich who once served Bane. As the adventurers enter, an oppressive aura fills the air, and the whispers of long-dead worshippers echo through the halls.

---

**Encounter Details:**

**Enemies:**
- **1 Lich (or a weaker version appropriate for your party’s level, such as a Lich's Undead Minion)**
- **2-4 Skeletons** (use stats for Skeletons)
- **1 Banite Cultist** (use stats for Cultists)
- **1 Specter** (to reinforce the undead theme)

**Lich Tactics:**
The Lich utilizes its lair to its advantage, casting spells like **Ray of Frost** and **Magic Missile** from the shadows. It commands the skeletons and cultists to engage the party while it employs tactical retreats into darkened alcoves of the temple.

---

**Setting:**
- **Environmental Hazards:** 
  - **Dim Light:** The temple is shrouded in darkness, with flickering shadows from old, extinguished braziers. Players must navigate carefully to avoid pitfalls.
  - **Banite Sigils:** Areas marked with Banite sigils may trigger effects such as **Inflict Wounds** or other necromantic spells when approached.

**Temple Features:**
- **Altar of Bane:** The central chamber houses a ruined altar, still decorated with dark offerings. If the party inspects it, they may find remnants of powerful dark magic or a hidden treasure.
- **Lair Actions:** On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the Lich can summon **1d4 Skeletons** from the nearby remains or activate a **glyph of warding** that triggers a magical effect.

---

**Encounter Mechanics:**
1. **Initial Ambush:** As the party investigates, the Lich animates the skeletons and directs the cultists to attack. The Specter emerges from the shadows to flank the party.
   
2. **Tactical Retreat:** If the Lich is losing, it will use its **Rejuvenation** ability, slipping into the shadows and leaving its minions to slow the party down.

3. **Potential Allies:** During the combat, the party may find a **spirit of a fallen Banite priest** trapped in the temple. If freed (by defeating the Lich or cleansing the temple), this spirit can provide insight into the lich's weaknesses and the dark rituals performed in the temple.

---

**Reward:**
Upon defeating the Lich, its minions, and possibly cleansing the temple, the party can find:
- A **Lich's Phylactery** containing valuable treasures (such as **Potion of Greater Healing**, **Scroll of Revivify**, and gold).
- A **Banite Amulet** that grants dark powers (with potential consequences), offering a chance for character development through the temptation of its use.

---

**Conclusion:**
This encounter adds layers of intrigue and moral complexity, highlighting the dark legacy of Bane and the consequences of power. Adjust the difficulty by modifying the number of enemies or their tactics based on your party's abilities. If you need any more changes or details, feel free to ask!
