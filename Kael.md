### Backstory

Kael Thornshadow is an **Aasimar**, born as a child of **Shar**, the Mistress of the Night. His mother, a powerful embodiment of shadow and loss, sought to create a being that would bridge the realms of light and darkness. Raised in the **Shadowfell**, Kael learned to embrace the shadows that surrounded him, understanding the beauty and power they hold.

From an early age, Kael was taught that darkness is not merely the absence of light, but a force that can bring freedom and release. In a world that often fears the dark, he found strength in its embrace. He learned that the shadows can shield secrets, protect the vulnerable, and provide solace to those who have suffered.

As he grew older, Kael became an acolyte of Shar, dedicating his life to the worship of the Mistress of the Night. He learned the sacred rites and rituals, delving into the teachings of darkness that his mother instilled in him. His role was not just to serve but to spread her influence and to encourage others to accept the dark as a source of strength.

Kael travels the realms with a singular purpose: to bring the embrace of darkness to those who need it most. He sees himself as a harbinger of Shar’s will, a dark shepherd guiding lost souls toward the comfort of the shadows. With every whispered prayer to Shar, he channels her power to deepen the shadows, making room for those who are tired of the blinding light.

His connection to darkness fuels his abilities as a cleric, allowing him to wield spells that can smother light and instill fear. He revels in the chaos that darkness can bring, believing it is a necessary counterbalance to the rigid structure of light. For Kael, the act of bringing darkness is not just a calling—it is a divine mission, a way to fulfill his mother’s legacy and assert the power of shadows in a world too often dominated by light.

As he walks the line between light and dark, Kael seeks to remind others that true freedom lies in accepting the shadows, and that only through embracing the dark can one truly understand the light. He will stop at nothing to achieve his vision, using any means necessary to bring about a world where darkness reigns.
