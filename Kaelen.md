### Backstory

Kaelin Windstrider hails from the **Misty Forest**, a mystical woodland known for its ethereal beauty and connection to the **Feywild**. Growing up among ancient trees and whispering streams, Kaelin was raised in harmony with nature. His parents were guardians of the forest, ensuring that its secrets remained safe from outside threats.

From a young age, Kaelin exhibited an affinity for the natural world. He often ventured deep into the forest, where he would meet fey creatures and learn the ancient ways of the land. It was in these enchanted glades that he honed his skills as a ranger, learning to move silently through the underbrush and communicate with the flora and fauna.

However, the tranquility of the Misty Forest was shattered when a dark force began encroaching upon its borders. Loggers and hunters, lured by the forest's resources, threatened to disrupt the delicate balance Kaelin held dear. Fueled by a sense of duty to protect his home, Kaelin took up his bow and swore to defend the woods and its inhabitants at all costs.

Now, he travels beyond the confines of the Misty Forest, seeking allies and ways to combat the encroaching darkness. His bond with nature remains strong, and he is determined to ensure that the beauty of the natural world is preserved for generations to come.
