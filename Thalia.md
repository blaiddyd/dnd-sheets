### Backstory

Thalia Silverleaf was born in the enchanting **Moonshae Isles**, where the melody of the waves and the whispers of the trees inspired her love for music and storytelling. Raised in a family of performers, she learned the art of song and dance at an early age, often captivating audiences with her enchanting performances.

However, the beauty of the Moonshae Isles belies its dangers, as ancient evils and dark forces occasionally threaten the delicate balance of nature. Inspired by the stories of her ancestors and their connection to the fey, Thalia took it upon herself to travel beyond the isles to share her music and fight for the preservation of freedom and creativity.

Now, Thalia journeys through the realms, seeking to gather tales and tunes from different lands while standing against those who would silence the voices of the innocent. With her lute in hand and her heart full of stories, she strives to bring light to the darkest places and inspire hope wherever she goes.
