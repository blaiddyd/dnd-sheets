### Backstory

Thorne Blackwood was born and raised in the bustling streets of **Waterdeep**, a city alive with commerce, intrigue, and danger. Growing up in a chaotic environment, Thorne learned early on how to navigate the complexities of urban life, using his wit and charm to survive. 

As a dragonborn with black dragon ancestry, he often felt like an outsider in a city filled with diverse races and cultures. This sense of alienation fueled his ambition, pushing him into the world of thievery and deception. He quickly rose through the ranks of a local thieves' guild, using his natural charisma and cunning to manipulate others to achieve his goals.

Thorne now seeks to expand his influence and establish himself as a powerful figure in Waterdeep’s underbelly. With a network of allies and a penchant for chaos, he navigates the shadows of the city, always looking for his next opportunity to seize power and wealth.
